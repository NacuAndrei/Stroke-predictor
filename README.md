Task: According to the World Health Organization stroke is the second leading
cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. We
propose you a dataset to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on
the input parameters like gender, age, and various health and social information.

This is a neural network model that predicts whether or not a patient is likely to have a stroke.
The model achieved a score of 99.2% accuracy.
